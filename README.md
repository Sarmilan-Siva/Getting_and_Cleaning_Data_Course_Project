#Readme - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
This repo is submitted for the course project of Johns Hopkin's Getting and Cleaning Data. The repo explains how all of the work was executed in order to create a Tidy Dataset which was instructed.

##Data Source
The Original Data, Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Datasets and a full description of the data used in this project can be found at the webpage.
The link is here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Performing the Analysis
The steps to create the Tidy Dataset is given in the Code Book file and also can be found in the same repo, and the R codes used to perform the analysis is given in the run_analysis.R file.
You need to set the directory within the *UCI HAR Dataset* folder and the Tidy Dataset will be created in the same directory as tidyData.txt.

##Instructions Given by the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit:
i. a tidy data set as described below,
ii. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
iii. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
