This repo is submitted for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course project and explains how all of the work was executed in order to create a Tidy Dataset which was instructed.

##Data Source
The Original Data, Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Datasets and a full description of the data used in this project can be found at the webpage.
The link is here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Performind The Analysis
The steps to create the Tidy Dataset is given in the Code Book file can be found in the same repo, and the R codes used to perform the analysis is given in the run_analysis.R file.
You need to set the directory within the *UCI HAR Dataset* folder and the Tidy Dataset will be created in the same directory as tidyData.txt.

##Instructions Given by the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit:
1) a tidy data set as described below,
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
